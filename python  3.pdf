elif b == "scissors" and c == "paper":
    print("You win")
else:
    print("Computer wins")

print("Press enter to roll the dice.")
a = 0
b = 0
while True:

    c = r()
    d = r()
    print(f"You rolled a {c}.")
    print(f"The computer rolled a {d}.")
    if c == 6:
        print("You win")
        break
    elif d == 6:
        print("The computer wins")
        break
